<p>
  Orange Dacha is a small new villa just next to Pererenan-Canggu popular expat enclave tucked away from busy roads and surrounded by lush rice paddies.

<p>
  Escape hustle and bustle of Seminyak and Kuta. It is very quiet here - we have only one neighbour (small expat villa), the rest - farm lands and empty local road. Enjoy rice field views and gorgeous sunsets from your balcony. Chill in the pool. Prepare your own refreshments in a self-use kitchen or ask our staff to make something for you.
