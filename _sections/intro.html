  Escape hustle and bustle of Seminyak and Kuta. It is very quiet here - we have only one neighbour (small expat villa), the rest - farm lands and empty local road. Enjoy rice field views and gorgeous sunsets from your balcony. Chill in the pool. Prepare your own refreshments in a self-use kitchen or ask our staff to make something for you.
