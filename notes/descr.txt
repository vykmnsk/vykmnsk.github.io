OrangeDacha is a small new guesthouse with a few rooms for rent just next to Canggu away from busy roads and surrounded by lush rice paddies. 
Pererenan, Echo and Batu Bolong beaches are easy 7-15 mins drive away. Pepito Market grocery - 4, Tanah Lot temple - 18, Ubud -1 hr. 
Enjoy a Queen size bed, A/C, hot water, strong WiFi, TV, DVD, 2nd floor, balcony with panoramic views, shared kitchen and Salt Water pool!

It is very quiet here - only one neighbour (small expat villa), the rest - farm lands and empty local road. You are on the top floor - nice breeze and no mosquitoes! Enjoy rice field views and gorgeous sunsets from your balcony. Chill in the pool. Prepare your drinks and meals in a self-use kitchen. Ask our housekeeper for anything (e.g. hairdrier, rent a motorbike).

Your room/bathroom are completely private, of course. Occasionally you may see another fellow guest or two at the pool, kitchen, balcony-terrace or stairs. The shared kitchen is equipped with a fridge, small gas stove, toaster, blender, drinking water, coffee, tea.

We are in a serene heritage village of Tumbak Bayuh, South-West Bali about 40-60 minutes drive (depending on traffic) from the the Ngurah Rai International Airport. Famous Tannah Lot temple is less than 20 mins, Ubud -1 hr.
Closest beach (Pererenan) is a strait 7 minute drive down the road. Famous (for surfing) Echo beach - 10 minutes. Popular (for swimming, live music) Batu Bolong beach - 15 minutes.

It's cheapest and quickest if you can rent and ride a scooter (ours for 50000rp/day if available). Alternatively our staff can help to arrange a taxi car or scooter (Grab, Gojek or local service).
